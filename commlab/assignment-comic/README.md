# THE CAT & THE MOUSE COMIC

## PROJECT DESCRIPTION 

Our project consists on a comic and interactive game with a cat and a mouse. When the user enters the comic, they are presented with an opening page. When the user clicks the start button, they are directed to the next panel, which is set in a bedroom. The user must click the object in which they believe the mouse is hiding in. if they user chooses the wrong option, they are directed to a page in which they are presented the option to try again. The user can try again and make through the entire comic. There are panels set up in a house setting like bedroom, living room, kitchen, bathroom, and garage. All the drawings are originally created by hand and then animated to give a somewhat natural feel to the comic. The experience we are striving to create is an interactive and fun comic, in which the user is able to have control on how the story progresses. The cursor is the cat so it feels like the player is actually hunting down the mouse. All the panels have two different places where possibly the mouse is hiding. The pointer becomes a hand cursor when the user is hovering on those specific places. If the user clicks the correct item. the story will progress. If not, the user must try again. We are aiming to make the user feel involved in the story, and a part of the comic. There is a plot twist at the end, which we hope will surprise the user and create a "happy ending". 

## PROCESS 

We decided to split the work amongst ourselves. 

### General division of labor

- Vladimir: planning, story and comic ideas, website HTML, CSS & JS
- Hind: comic and story ideas, drawings for the panels, main character sketches, aesthetics
- Raya: comic and story ideas, drawing sketches for the panels, images, aesthetics
- Zion: planning, story and comic ideas, panel sketch, animation and website coding

### Timeline

- Initial meeting to discuss potential ideas for the comic and general divison of labor
- Second meeting to narrow down on one single idea (the one we implemented) and discuss the exact tasks of everyone
- Over the next few days, Hind and Raya created the art, while Vladimir and Zion worked on the website
- For the website, initially Vladimir created the main HTML components and styled them. He also developed the code framework: starting and restarting the game, moving between panels, handling animation triggers, etc. Shortly after Zion worked on the visuals to create a comforting feel to the whole page, and also added sounds, the cat following the cursor, and other necessary polishing improvements.

## REFLECTION 

While our initial idea was to create a comic story revolving around the 9 lives of a cat, the idea was too complex and exceeded the 6 panel limit. Therefore, we decided to have a cat and mouse story. The overall comic was what we expected, and met our goals, as it was interactive and told a story. The cat seemingly wanted to catch a mouse so it could eat it, but turns out... play the game to find out!
