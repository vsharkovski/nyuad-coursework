## [A Day in the Life of a Student at NYU Abu Dhabi](https://vsharkovski.github.io/commlab-sound/)

>Group: Liza, Vladimir, Yiyang, Pranav
### Description
This website hosts a project piece aimed at presenting the life of a typical NYU Abu Dhabi student using solely the elements of audio and some supporting images. We as students in this university believe that there is/are some specific sound(s) associated with every place we visit - so much so that we can visulaize the scenario using solely the sounds. 

Keeping this in mind, we wanted to record those particular sounds that clearly establishes the memory of a particular place and present various such sounds together in a sequence that a student here follows from the time they wake up to the end of their day. Using the techniques for recording we've learnt during our workshop with Terry May, we have recorded various sounds and compiled them using the software to create an audio piece.

**Software used:** Audacity, iMovie

### Process
- First, we made a note of all the sounds we require (in a sequential order): like alarm, brushing teeth, cereal for breakfast, etc. 
- We then searched for certain common sounds like alarm and brushing the teeth if they are available on stock sounds using the website called [PixaBay](https://pixabay.com/sound-effects/) to combine with the recorded sounds to save some time. 
- Meanwhile we also got started on the website having a basic template for various images that can show up at different parts of the audio journey.
- We set out to record the audio: we started with the marketplace, then to the Library for typing sounds, Table Tennis and Pool at the Baraha, Convenience Store, Tapping the ID, Palms, D1 (dining hall on campus), fountains, and other sounds in the way - to exactly mimic the sounds a student would hear usually.
- Once recorded, we had to break the audio to different parts for us to compile back together easily. We categorized them based on different sounds.
- Once categorized, we referred to our first sequential order of sounds created by how our typical day goes by, and compiled back the sounds in the same sequence.
- The audio was then coverted to stereo and uploaded onto the website. The relavant images can be found there as well - to portray an element of engaging the audience in our story.


### Reflections
- We are quite satisfied with the final result that we've achieved in this short period of time. 
- The Marketplace and D1 sounds are very similar so it is difficult to differentiate between both of them. A scope to improve would have been to record someone ordering at a specific place in the marketplace but that would've compromised with our idea of not having any voices. 
- Cutting the huge audio to various parts was a challenging task as we had to remove our voices, any unnecessary ones and only keep those that can convey the place in a short and sweet way.
