# Assignment 4: Video | Nov 2
## [NYUAD News](https://vsharkovski.github.io/commlab-video/)

>Group: Vladimir, Ramsha, Basil & Pranav
### Description
This website hosts short clips of the news channel - NYUAD News which covers the most recent happenings at NYU Abu Dhabi and presents them to their viewers. The clips aim to create a comic and funny vibe through the dialogues, the videography techniques, and the setting overall.

This assignment is undertaken to showcase the necessary fiming techniques and website building skills. Keeping the above factors in mind, the website shows 3 particular videos for 3 different scenarios. Although the news channel would technically have one huge video, we created individual videos to mimic the actual real-world news channels' websites.

**Software used:** Final Cut Pro

### Process
- First, we made a note of all the scenes we plan to shoot. For eg., one scene for a person falling off near the palms, one in D2 for fire, etc. 
- Then we went on to create the script, having dialogues written for each character and the time of the day that is ideal for the particular shot. 
- Meanwhile we had the basic template of the website ready with placeholder videos, that are ready to be replaced by the ones that will be shot according to the script. 
- We then also went on to create a storyboard, not really a visual attractive one, but a brief of the scene along with some images that were in mind. 
- On the day of the shoot, we could not find the necessary adapter as we got the wrong one, and had to wait for a few days to begin working.
- Once we were ready to sheet, we had to shoot in an atmosphere that wasn't ideal due to time constraints. However, the shots seemed to be pretty good.
- We took time to rehearse the dialogues, and once we got to it, we did not take more than one shot except for the first video. 
- Once the video was done, we uploaded the files to Google Drive and EditShare, and immediately got to editing the video. 
- Final Cut Pro was really helpful and intuitive to work with, which made the job super easy. 
- Each video had to be cut exactly once the commentary for the particular happening and the following had to be played with the introductory clip of NYUAD news which was interesting to work with as it took quite some trials to work on more than one project at once.
- Some transitions and templates were taken from Final Cut Pro and some of the music media from [PixaBay](https://pixabay.com/sound-effects/).
- We had videos ready - we uploaded them to Vimeo since GitHub cannot host videos more than 100mb.
- Finally, we added the videos to the website, and it is now ready!

### Reflections
- We are quite satisfied with the final result that we've achieved in this short period of time. 
- Getting to the dialogues was pretty well taken by the crew and we enjoyed shooting the videos and editing them.
- It was a little stressful to have not received the right adapter which pushed our assignment deadline. However, we got to it and for the time we had, we could work hand in hand and finish the assignment.
