          Hello there! I'm Mr. Bear and this is my website. Here you can find
          some info about myself, my contact information, as well as some recent

              I'm a bear. A stuffed toy teddy bear, that is! Not a real bear. I
              would imagine that if I were a real bear, I would be a grizzly.
              Grizzly bears are cool and huge and powerful, and they eat
              whatever they like.

              I don't really remember where I come from or how I came into this
              world. All I know is that I've been living in NYUAD for as long as
              I remember.

              My most recent hobby is studying how to create websites with HTML,
              CSS and JavaScript. I hope you like the effects I added!

              Recently some NYUAD students realized that I am not a regular old
              teddy bear, and that I can move and talk. So they decided to
              interview me and ask me some questions.

            <p>
              Here is the video they recorded. I hope you like it! If you have

          This website was created as part of the 30 Minute Film Festival. Our
          'movie' was the interview, for which we only had thirty minutes to
          record and edit. Then we had to create a web page where we would
          convey a story. We hope you liked it!
