## Project Name

Mr. Bear's Personal Website

## Project Description

This is a website intended to look like a personal site of a stuffed teddy bear at NYUAD. The 'story' which the website tries to convey is that the bear created the site, and is talking to the reader, in several different sections throughout the page.

There are five sections, ordered in the following way:

1. The 'Welcome' section, which contains a greeting from the bear.
2. The 'About me' section, where the bear says basic fictional facts about itself. There is also a picture of the teddy bear waving which, when clicked, cycles to an alternate picture and can be clicked again to cycle to the original picture.
3. The 'Recent interview' section, which contains a video interview of the bear, and a comment describing what the video is about.
4. The 'Contact me' section, which contains a hyperlink which, when clicked, opens a native platform-dependent popup to send an email to the bear; the bear's email address is fake.
5. The 'Behind the scenes' section, _which is initially hidden_. It talks about the people who created the video and website, and a link to the Communications Lab website.

Besides the sections, there is a navigation bar at the top of the screen, which stays visible no matter where the user scrolls. The navigation bar has 5 elements:

- Four anchors, one for each section, except for the 'Behind the scenes' section. Each anchor, when clicked, makes the website scroll down to the appropriate section the anchor is for.
- A teddy bear logo, which smoothly rotates and changes position (from left to right to left...) throughout the rest of the space of the navigation bar.

To display the 'Behind the scenes' section, a series of steps must be taken. For the unwitting user to find out about this, there is a small hint immediately after the 'Contact me' section, which is just text and outlines the following sequential steps:

1. Click the teddy bear logo three times
2. Click the picture in the 'About me' section
3. Click a piece of underlined text in the hint text

The time window to do these steps is 8 seconds, and they must be done in order. Once the steps are done, the section appears and the window scrolls down to it.

## Process

The following steps were taken:

1. Filmed and edited the video with other people.
2. Thought about what the website would look like and the story it would convey.
3. Created a wireframe of the website using Adobe XD.
4. Started creating the website, simultaneously working on the HTML and CSS, and using the wireframe as a rough guide.
5. Added interactivity using JavaScript and jQuery.
6. Made small improvements and polished everything.

## Reflection / Evaluation

Overall, the final website looks mostly like how I imagined it at the start. However, I did not initially have comprehensive ideas about interactivity. Instead, I added the interactive elements after most of the content and styling had been done. Overall, my expectations and goals for the content and styling were promptly met, and my expectations for the interactivity were exceeded due to the idea with the 'Behind the scenes' section.
